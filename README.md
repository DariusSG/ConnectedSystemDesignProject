# Project Overview
Our project aims to create a locker to combat package theft, resulting in the creation of DeliverEase.

## Reasons for creation
Package theft has been on the rise recently especially during the Covid pandemic where people have ordered items online ranging from food delivery, groceries to packages. While the theft of these items are not common, it is extremely annoying if it happens to you as such items could be time sensitive. We know Singapore is moving towards becoming a smart nation, where people are more interconnected than ever through their smart devices. Knowing that your packages are safe from theft allows one to have a piece of mind that their package is safe. Our product aims to be easy to use regardless of userâ€™s demographic, ensuring that the product can be used by everyone and not just only people who are tech savvy.
